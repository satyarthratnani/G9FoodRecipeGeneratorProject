# G9_food_Recipe_Generator_project
Food Recipe Generator System

We aim to make a user aware of the various dishes which can be cooked from available set of ingredients or an input image given by a user.
Thus, systems like this never get their place in real life. We deciding to developed a Recipe Generation model by applying Neural Network on it. The tools used for developing the project are Python, React, CSS, JavaScript & Flask or Django.
   A dynamic website incorporating machine learning techniques.
   Search options:
   Search by Ingredients and name
   Search by food image
Output: self-generated recipes
It is a recipe generator system and not a recommender system!!!
